# Annimated Preloader
âœ¨ Successfully implemented an animated preloader âœ¨
During my web development internship at Dynamite Webtech, I created a smooth and responsive animated preloader using HTML and CSS. This preloader enhances the user experience by indicating loading progress with a stylish animation.

ðŸ’» Key Features:
âœ… Smooth and fluid animation
âœ… Fully customizable (colors, size, speed)
âœ… Pure HTML and CSS â€“ no dependencies

ðŸ”¥ This project helped me enhance my frontend skills and understand the importance of UI/UX optimization for better website performance.
